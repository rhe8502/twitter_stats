# Twitter Stats

**Twitter Stats** is a small Python 3 program using Tweepy and the official Twitter API.

The program displays user name, current tweet count and followers (Subs) on a Display-O-Tron 3000. The bar light gives a visual notification if a new follower is gained, or lost.

Refer to the README.md file in the parent folder to get going.
